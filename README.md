### **Sorting and Searching - 

Sorting and searching are fundamental concepts in computer science, used to organize and retrieve data efficiently.

### **1. Sorting Algorithms**  
Sorting arranges data in a specific order (ascending or descending). Common sorting algorithms include:

- **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order (O(n²)).  
- **Selection Sort**: Selects the smallest element and swaps it with the first unsorted position (O(n²)).  
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds a sorted list by inserting elements at the correct position (O(n²), O(n) for nearly sorted data).  
- **Merge Sort**: Uses a divide-and-conquer approach, recursively splitting the array and merging (O(n log n)).  
- **Quick Sort**: Selects a pivot, partitions the array, and recursively sorts (O(n log n) best, O(n²) worst).  
- **Heap Sort**: Converts an array into a heap and extracts elements in sorted order (O(n log n)).  
- **Radix Sort**: Sorts numbers digit by digit, useful for non-comparative sorting (O(nk)).  

### **2. Searching Algorithms**  
Searching is used to find elements in a data structure.

- **Linear Search**: Checks each element sequentially (O(n)).  
- **Binary Search**: Requires sorted data, divides the array and searches in halves (O(log n)).  
- **Jump Search**: Skips a fixed number of elements, then performs linear search (O(√n)).  
- **Interpolation Search**: Optimized for uniformly distributed data, predicts the position (O(log log n) best).  

### **3. Comparison of Sorting & Searching Algorithms**  
| Algorithm       | Best Case   | Worst Case  | Average Case  | Stable? |
|---------------|------------|------------|--------------|---------|
| Bubble Sort   | O(n)       | O(n²)      | O(n²)        | Yes     |
| Selection Sort| O(n²)      | O(n²)      | O(n²)        | No      |
| Insertion Sort| O(n)       | O(n²)      | O(n²)        | Yes     |
| Merge Sort    | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n)   | Yes     |
| Quick Sort    | O(n log n) | O(n²)      | O(n log n)   | No      |
| Heap Sort     | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n)   | No      |

### **4. Applications of Sorting & Searching**
- **Databases** (indexing and retrieval)  
- **Networking** (packet routing and scheduling)  
- **E-commerce** (product ranking and filtering)  
- **Machine Learning** (data preprocessing and feature selection)
